# Bootstarter

This is a team project for Afdemp Coding Bootcamp 7 of 2019.


You can visit the web application at http://bootstarter.azurewebsites.net/ (it will be up and running until 5th of June 2019).

  The application is a crowdfunding site that promotes fresh ideas and let people donate money so the project will continue to develope and expand.
  All the core elements are there, from register and login to adding a photo, a description and the amount of money each project needs. There are 3 roles that are supported in this application. 
  
  Founder is the first of these roles, the people or person behind the project who can donate to other projects and have always a review of own's project progress, like the total money gathered for the projects campaign, the number of backings, etc.
  Donator comes second, where people can register under this role and can only donate to any available project, no other action is allowed. This role can visit all the available places of the site (like anyone else being without an account), except that can always keep track of their donations through their account options.
  The third role is no other than the Administrator who can act as Founder plus the ability to be able to "interact" with other founders projects and donations and the only one to have full privileges to interact with everything in the database.

[bug report]
Right after the registration the user appears to be logged in, but trying to interact with the site asks them to log in. The problem gets solved by logging out and loggin in back again. It does not show again and everything works well thereafter.

The project started mid of April 2019 and was finished by 9th of May at the same year.
Contributors to this project were Amartolos Nikos, Katsiaounis Thanos and Paraskevaides Marios.
